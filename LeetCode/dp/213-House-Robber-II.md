## [213. House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. 
All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. 
Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses 
were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
## Answer
### Method 1 - DP - :rocket: 0ms
Since House[1] and House[n] are adjacent, they cannot be robbed together. Therefore, the problem becomes to rob either `House[1] to House[n-1]` or `House[2] to House[n]`, depending on which choice offers more money. Now the problem has degenerated to the House Robber, which is already been solved.

```java
class Solution {
    // 0ms
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null) return 0;
        if (nums.length <= 1) return nums.length == 0 ? 0 : nums[0];
        
        return Math.max(rob(nums, 0, nums.length - 2), rob(nums, 1, nums.length - 1));
    }
    
    private int rob(int[] nums, int l, int h) {
        int rob = 0, notRob = 0;
        
        for (int i = l; i <= h; i++) {
            int preRob = rob, preNotRob = notRob;
            rob = preNotRob + nums[i];
            notRob = Math.max(preRob, preNotRob);
        }
        
        return Math.max(rob, notRob);
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0)
            return 0;

        if (nums.length == 1)
            return nums[0];

        int max1 = rob(nums, 0, nums.length - 2);
        int max2 = rob(nums, 1, nums.length - 1);
        return Math.max(max1, max2);
    }
    
    private int rob(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        int[] rob = new int[nums.length];
        int[] notRob = new int[nums.length];
        
        rob[start] = nums[start];
        
        for (int i = start + 1; i <= end; i++) {
            rob[i] = nums[i] + notRob[i - 1];
            notRob[i] = Math.max(rob[i - 1], notRob[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return Math.max(rob[end], notRob[end]);
    }
}
```
