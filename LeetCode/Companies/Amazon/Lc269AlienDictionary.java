/**Problem:
 * There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you.
 *
 * You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically
 * by the rules of this new language.
 *
 * Derive the order of letters in this language.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 *   "wrt",
 *   "wrf",
 *   "er",
 *   "ett",
 *   "rftt"
 * ]
 *
 * Output: "wertf"
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 *   "z",
 *   "x"
 * ]
 *
 * Output: "zx"
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 *   "z",
 *   "x",
 *   "z"
 * ]
 *
 * Output: ""
 *
 * Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
 * Note:
 *
 * You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
 * You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
 * If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
 * There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.
